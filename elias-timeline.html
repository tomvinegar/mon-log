 <h2>Jackson Elias: Timeline</h2>


Elias, a lifelong skeptic, found his world upended after meeting something truly other in the form of Augsutus Larkin. This is an outline of what is presently known about Jackson Elias' trail as he followed his final, fatal case. 
<ul>
<li> May 1923: Jackon leaves New York bound for London to begin work on his next book. During this visit he met with Mickey Mahoney at the Scoop. With leads from the paper, he reached out to Inspector Barrington of Scotland Yard regarding the killings in Soho. Jackson claimed the killings were the work of an Egyptian cult called the Bortherhood of the Black Pharoah based on the method of death. Jackson also interviewed Edward Gavigan, the director of the Penhew Foundation.</li>
<li> July 1924: Jackson arrives in Nairobi, Kenya. He contacts Jonah Kensington shortly after. His notes state that he has reasaon to believe that some or all of the members of the Carlyle Expedition may have survived. He believes a cult called The Bloody Tongue was involved in their fate. An interview with a man in Nairobi, "Nails" Nelson, reveals that Nails had seen Jack "Brass" Brady alive and well in Hong Kong not two years ago- long after he was pronounced dead. </li>
<li> August 1924: Jackson leaves Kenya for China. He  writes Kensington from Hong Kong in September, staing only that his research was proceeding nicely and his leads were proving correct.
<li> October 1924: Jackson leaves China via Shanghai for Cairo, Egypt.</li>
<li> November 1924: Jackson leaves Egypt for London. He has a second appointment scheduled with Gavigan that never happens. He again writes Kensington. He claims to have seen unbelievable things and spoke of a monstrous plan of global proportions. He claims there is a timetable for the plan but that he was still missing pieces and that a trip to Australia would be needed. He would say no more in messages and claimed that he was returning to New York imminently.</li>
<li> December 1924: Jackson leaves London for New York. During the crossing he contacts the party and asks them to meet him in New York.</li>
<li> January 1925: Jackson meets with Kensington and leaves his notes in his care. Jonah reported that Jackson seemed almost out of his mind, fearful and paranoid. Along with his resarch notes, Elias left a bizarre note with Jonah that claimed all members of the expedition surivived and that "they will open the gate". His insane ramblings repeat that the enemy has many names and many forms but are all the same and are all working to the same end.</li>
<li> January 1925: The party arrive at the hotel Chelsea to find Jackson Elias brutally murdered by members of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.</li>
