 <h2>Jackson Elias: Timeline</h2>


This is an outline of what is presently known about Jackson Elias' journey on his final, fatal case. 
<ul>
  <li>March 1921: Jackson, a lifelong skeptic, discoved something truly other taking the form of Augustus Larkin and the monstrous Father of Maggots in Peru. The rest of his life was spent trying to learn about these dark forces, what infected Larkin and why.</li>
  <li> May 1923: Following Larkin's trail, Jackon leaves New York for London en route to Africa. Africa was Larkin's home and the birthplace of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue, the symbol of which was tattoed on Larkins chest.</li>
  <li> July 1924: Following leads in Africa leads Jackson to Nairobi. He wired Jonah Kensington shortly after. Jackson claimed he had reasaon to believe that, contrary to the accepted story, some or all of the members of the infamous Carlyle Expedition may have survived. He believes The Bloody Tongue may have been involved in their fate. An interview with a man in Nairobi, "Nails" Nelson, reveals that Nails had seen Jack "Brass" Brady alive and well in Hong Kong not two years ago- long after he was pronounced dead. Jackson begins investigating the Carlyle Expedition.</li>
  <li> August 1924: Jackson leaves Kenya for China. He  writes Kensington from Hong Kong in September, staing only that his research was proceeding nicely and his leads were proving correct.
  <li> October 1924: Jackson leaves China via Shanghai for Cairo, Egypt.</li>
  <li> November 1924: Jackson leaves Egypt for London.  While there, an article in The Scoop about a series of murders in Soho caught his interest. He contacted Scotland Yard and claimed, based on the method of death, that the killings were the work of an Egyptian cult called the Bortherhood of the Black Pharoah. Jackson also interviewed Edward Gavigan, the director of the Penhew Foundation, the fonder of which was a key member of the Carlyle Expedition.</li> 
  <li> December 1924: Jackson interviewed Gavigan again, and had scheduled another that never came to pass. He again writes Kensington. He claims to have seen unbelievable things and spoke of a monstrous plan of global proportions. He claims there is a timetable for the plan but that he was still missing pieces and that a trip to Australia would be needed. He would say no more in messages and claimed that he was returning to New York immediately, believing he was in danger. His sanity seemed frayed.</li>
  <li> December 1924: Jackson leaves London for New York. During the crossing he contacts the party and asks them to meet him in New York, presumably to help work the case.</li>
  <li> January 1925: Jackson meets with Kensington and leaves his notes in his care. Jonah reported that Jackson seemed almost out of his mind, fearful and paranoid. Along with his resarch notes, Elias left a bizarre note with Jonah that claimed all members of the expedition surivived and that "they will open the gate". His insane ramblings repeat that the enemy has many names and many forms but are all the same and are all working to the same end.</li>
  <li> January 1925: The party arrive at the hotel Chelsea to find Jackson Elias brutally murdered by members of the Cult of the Bloody Tongue.</li>
