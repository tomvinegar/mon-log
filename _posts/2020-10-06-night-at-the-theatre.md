title: "Twelve: Night at the Theatre"
---

Analise and Hank learn more about the death cult, the cult unleash an attack at the Lafayette theatre, and a riot rampages through Harlem.... 

* Millie explains what Hilton had learned and what he was doing about it. Having spotted the 'janitor' the group make a move toward the balcony prompting the janitor into action. 
* The janitor and two other masked cultists attack the group in the theatre. 
* Meanwhile at Harvard Aanlise and Hank meet Professor Atwright. She explains Jackson had called ahead for a rare volume in the library and she had been holding it for him. Before he arrived, a muscular African man visited asking about the same volume. He only asked to see where it was, then left. That same night the book would simply disappear. The shelves around it appeared burned and the stench of brimstone hung in the air. 
* Hank and Analise share the mark carved into Jackson's head. Atwright agrees to see if she can source it, and they agree to help her with her research. After an all-nighter they discover the cult is of African origin and called the Cult of the Bloody Tongue. 
* Back in Harlem the fight goes poorly: Judge is shot and incapacitated. Jon kills one of the cultists as he attempts to flee with Rebecca. Charlotte escapes through a fire door. The sound of gun fire attracts attention on the street. 
* Judge forces himself to keep fighting as Charlotte gets Steve from the car to help. A crowd gathers; Milles cousin Bruce hides her in the car. Charlotte and Jon re-enter the theatre as Rebecca is under attack. Steve is shot. Jon dives from the balcony and assaults out the attacker while Judge saves Steve. Charlotte pulls the chandelier onto a cultist.  The last surivving cultist runs outside and is killed in a hale of police gunfire, which causes the crowd to riot. The group use the riot as cover to flee with Millie, Bruce and Rebecca. 
* On the way back home Analise and Hank meet Cowles one more time and share what they learn. Both parites agree to share information. 
* Back in New York, but groups meet at the penthouse. Steve and Judge have their wounds treated while they catch each other up, and it dawns on them that Steve left behind a sword engraved with Hanks name...
