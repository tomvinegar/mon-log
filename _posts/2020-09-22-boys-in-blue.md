title: "Ten: The Boys in Blue"
---

The party pay an early morning visit to the NYPD as guests of Captain Robson, Hank's home is robbed, Jon, Ed and Charlotte reach out to Lt. Poole, and Analise and Hank meet an unepxected passenger on a train to Massachusetts.

- Jonah Kensington, Jacksons publisher, meets the group at Carlton Ramseys office and tells them he has information about Jackson. He asks them to stop by in the morning; tonight will be for rememberance. 
- Early the next morning the group is awoken by a group of police officers who have tracked them from the crime scene at the hotel. The officers- Roberts, Williams, and White- ask the group to come peaceably to the 14th in Harlem, to which they agree, with the promise that Carlton will represent them.
- At the 14th the group and Carlton meet Captain Robson. He seems too well dressed for a captains salary. Robson suggests that the group were actually innocent bystanders to a crime about drugs; he paints a story of an open and shut case, and the party agrees to it. 
- As they leave the station they catch a glimpse of a prisoner in an interrogation room. While his face is unseen, his clothes reveal him to be the cultist that escaped from the hotel. 
- Butler Steve picks the group up and brings them back to the apartment, only to find it had been burgled. The door had been visibly pried open, and nothing of value was stolen; the evidence from Jacksons room had been safely stored in a hidden safe.
- The party agree to split up: Charlotte, Jon and Ed arrage to meet with Lt. Poole, who was clearly no friend of Robsons, at a coffee shop in Queens. Analise and Hank board a train bound for Miskatonic University to meet Profressor Cowles based on a leaflet found in Jacksons room. 
- Poole turns out to be desperate for help. He shares that he had been working on a serial murder case about two years ago, multiple people missing, and bodies desecrated with the same symbol Jackson had carved into his head. He was making progress but lost the 7th lost the case to the 14th under Captain Robson. A man called Hilton Adams as quickly arrested, convicted and sentenced to death, and is on death row now. Poole wasn't convinced then, and is sure they have the wrong man now. 
- Poole suggests they follow up with Hiltons wife Millie, or Rebecca Shosenberg from the Times. He asks they keep in touch and he'll do the same, but it'll be his career if he gets caught meddling. 
- On the train to Massachusetts Analise and Hank have a drink in the dining car. They only notice they're alone when the last passenger leaves. They turn to find their bartender is none other than Augustus Larkin...
