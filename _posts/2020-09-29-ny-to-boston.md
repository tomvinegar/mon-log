title: "Eleven: New York to Boston"
---

Analise and Hankd ride the rails with Larkin and meet Professor Cowles at Misktatonic University while the others dig deeper into the mystery, and the unfortunate case of Hilton Adams... 


- After subding Analise, Larkin claims that the bell-boy they framed in Peru was the nephew of the police captain. The captain was able to find Larkins body, as well as the person who rented the group the truck. The renter was tortured into revealing their indentities. 
- Larkin makes a reference to a woman that sent him to Peru in the first place.  He suggest Jacksons death is the first taste of her revenge. 
- As he tells his story they enter multiple tunnels which send them unrecognizable landscapes. Visions of pyramids in the desert and dark jungles whip past. Finally a bullet-shaped object disappears into the sun, which collapses into darknes; long, sentinent black tentalces reach out from it's heart and consume the sun and reach toward earth...
- They awaken to a conductor screaming at them; they have been in the baggage car tearing it apart in a frenzy. Larkin is nowhere to be seen.
- In New York, Poole leads the investigators to his car, and shares with him a box of his case files. As he leaves, they group spot a car following him. Jon calls in a tip to the 14th to ensure his safe travel. 
- The group spend the remainder of the evening reading the case files. Charlotte is able to piece together the evidence, which clearly suggests Hilton Adams is innoccent and police corruption is hiding the truth and even a deadly cult. 
- In Misktanic Hank and Analise meet the very eccentric Professor Anthony Cowles and his daughter Eva. He is not able to say much about Jackson, but is shares that his lecture was about the Cult of the Sand Bat, a mythical group he believes is real and operating even now. He shares his contacts in Australia. 
- Analise and Hank decide to stay in the area and again take a train, this time to Harvard to meet Profressor Cowles, also identified by Jacksons items.
- In New York, the group meet Rebecca Shosenberg at the times. She tells them Hilton Adams has been framed, and the real killers are also resonsible for Jacksons death. She agrees to take them to meet Hiltons wife. 
- The group meet Millie Jackson at the Lafayette theatre in Harlem. As Millie shares her story Jon spots a 'cleaner' in the balcony watching them intently...
