title: "Six: Bad to Worse"
---

Mendoza strikes again, Narya's life hangs in the balance, Jackson takes matters into his own hands, and the party quickly exits Puno.

* The battle pauses as the Kharisari rise and Jackson informs everyong that Mendoza had 'impregnated' Narya with a maggot. 
* Mendoza howls at the group for betraying 'The Master' and tells them her life is the price. No further transgressions will be permitted. 
* Jon agrees to Mendozas terms and says he will finish Narya himself; instead, he thrusts the golden ward through the head of Mendoza. 
* Mendoza and the other Kharisari disppear beneath lake as help arrives.
* Jackson slices Narya open and the maggot is removed. The old woman will survive. Having lost the trust of the locals, the group returns to their hotel.
* Larkin awaits them in the lobby, sitting in the dark bar alone. He taunts them a bit, his evil side apparent. Jackson, reaching a breaking point, shoots the man in the head. 
* The taunting continues even as the body dies; now, the voice matches the one Charlotte heard in her mirror-vision. The body fails before the spirit and Larkin is no more. 
* The desk boy, having seen the whole thing, flees for help, but Ed and Storm knock him out and bring to Jacksons room. 
* They wrap Larkin in a rug and pour booze on the desk boy to discredit him. They determine to leave Puno immediately, and Jackson reveals Narya shared the location of the temple; they must beat Mendoza there and put an end to the Kharisari and the curse. 
* Analise loads the truck and heads for the hills...
