The police get involved again, the party meets Arthur Emerson and learns about Ju-Ju House, Judge takes a part-time, and the group returns to Harlem to meet the Marlem Hellfighters... 

* Millie and Bruce leave the penthouse. Soon after police from Captain Robsons 7th arrive to arrest the party. Rebecca points out that if the group were responsible for the trouble in Harlem, that mean the police story of gang violence wouldn't be true. Unsure of how to handle the conflict, the police back down. 
* Before leaving the cops make very specific threats and innuendo regarding the party and people close to them. Jon finds their amount of knowledge curious. He sends a telegram to his employer to see if there's been any requests about him to the police in the UK. 
* The party make their way to Emerson's Imports. They share the card they found with Jackson.  Emerson is saddneed to hear about Jackson's death
* Emerson explains he does decent business with a place called Ju-Ju House, which sells African artifacts and artwork. Emerson's company specializes in imports/ exports from Africa, and Ju-Ju House is their primary customer. Jackson had been around previously asking the same.
* He explains the owner, Silas N'Kwane, is an ancient man whom Emerson finds creepy. 
* Before they leave Emerson challenges Judge to an arm wrestling match. Judges wounds slow him down enough for Emerson to win, and the cost is that Judge works at the shop for the day.
* The rest of the group head to Teddy's bar in Harlem. The bartender, Teddy Pepper, points them to a silent group in the back. The group take a seat with Hilton Adams old friends, the Harlem Hellfighters.
