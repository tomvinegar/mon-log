        The following is common informaton on the doomed expedition and its members, all gleamed from newspaper records of the story. 

<ul>
<li>In 1919 the group leave New York to undergo an archeological exedition in Egypt. Their goal is kept private. The principles are: 
<ul>
  <li> Roger Carlyle, the leader. A mid-twenties wealthy socialite and notorious party boy. Roger ran the family business but made more headlines for his decadent lifestyle. </li>
  <li> Doctor Robert Huston, pyschologist. Huston had gained considerable popularity with New York cities elite as a preeminent pyschologist of the Freudian variety. </li>
  <li> Hypatia Masters. Another socialite with reported romantic links to Carlyle. Miss Masters is an accomplished photographer and intended to document the expedition. </li>
  <li> Jack "Brass" Brady. Roger Carlyles' closest friend and bodyguard. </li>
  <li> Aubrey Penhew, a world reknowned Egyptologist and director of the Penhew Foundation in London which is itself concerned with ancient civilization. Penhew is the very portrait of the English upper class and a man of great wealth and resources.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The group sail from New York to London in April 1919 where they join with Penhew and undertake research at his foundation.</li>
<li>They arrive in Egypt in May and begin their efforts.</li>
<li>The expediition unexpectedly leaves Cairo in July and head to Kenya for some rest. Penhew becomes leader with Carlyle apparently suffering from heatstroke. Rumours swiril of a discovery, but the expedition denies the claims.</li>
<li>The party leave Mombassa for a hunting trip in Nairobi. They embark with guides and bearers on August 3rd. Rumours circulate that the safari is a cover story, and that the expedition is in search of some other treasure, but are unconfirmed. They are not heard from again. </li>
<li>Erica Carlyle arrives in Africa in March 1920 after credibile rumours emerge of a massacre in the forest. Her expedition sets out to find her brother.</li>
<li>The massacre is confirmed in May 1920  when Ericas expedition discovers the massacare site deep in the forest. More than two dozen bodies are found butchered. Nandi tribe members are blamed for the attack.</li>
<li>Five Nandi tribe members are tried as ringleaders of the attack, found guilty and executed in June 1920. Erica Carlyle returns to America.</li>
</ul>
