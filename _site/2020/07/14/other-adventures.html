    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>1922:
    <ul>
      <li>the party, along with Jackson, RCMP officer and tracker Amaruq Inaluk, and anothropologist Camilla Thornton head to the frozen Canadian north, eventually discovering a race of blue-skinned pygmies living in the tundra. The violent tribe attacks all outsiders, including Inuit that stray too close to their territory.</li>
      <li>Inaluk leads the group into their mountain home so they may learn more of the group, as well as rumours of strange powers and magic they are rumoured to control.</li>
      <li>The party discover a massive blue heart at the core of the mountain providing light and heat, and soon realize that the mountain is in fact a slumbering god, and the tribe live within it’s body.</li>
