        <h1>Three: Mendoza Round Two</h1>
<p>09 Jun 2020</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hank and Storm attack Mendoza but get the worst of it; both are grievously injured.</li>
  <li>Charlotte pulls the maggot free from Sanchez with her telekinesis. The arriving Ed helps her trap it within a large ashtray. Jackson blasts Mendoza again.</li>
  <li>Jackson, Sanchez, and Charlotte head to the Hotel Cordova as emergency services arrive to address the fire and gunshots. Jon stays to talk to the authorities. Ed, Analise, Hank and Storm set out to find medical help.</li>
  <li>John convinces the police that he is merely an innocent passer-by seeking knowledge, and that a man inside has been grievously wounded by a cayman. Leading the police to Sanchezâ€™s office they discover Mendoza has disappeared again. He learns the library fire was intentionally set with gasoline; perhaps by the strange white man who was lost in the crowd. He agrees to meet the police later at Hotel Espana under a fake name.</li>
  <li>Ed, Analise, andHank find the worst vet in Lima.</li>
  <li>Charlotte arrives at the bar with the box of artifacts where she meets Larkin. He asks her for the golden rod and seems to transform; all his weakness fades away and his eyes turn jet black. Charlotte gives him the rod.</li>
  <li>The party regroups at the bar. Ed shows the group the mirror. He and Jon both view it, and are granted disturbing visions.</li>
</ul>
