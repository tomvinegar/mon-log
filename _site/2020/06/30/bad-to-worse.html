<p>30 Jun 2020</p>

<ul>
  <li>The battle pauses as the Kharisari rise and Jackson informs everyong that Mendoza had ‘impregnated’ Narya with a maggot.</li>
  <li>Mendoza howls at the group for betraying ‘The Master’ and tells them her life is the price. No further transgressions will be permitted.</li>
  <li>Jon agrees to Mendozas terms and says he will finish Narya himself; instead, he thrusts the golden ward through the head of Mendoza.</li>
  <li>Mendoza and the other Kharisari disppear beneath lake as help arrives.</li>
  <li>Jackson slices Narya open and the maggot is removed. The old woman will survive. Having lost the trust of the locals, the group returns to their hotel.</li>
  <li>Larkin awaits them in the lobby, sitting in the dark bar alone. He taunts them a bit, his evil side apparent. Jackson, reaching a breaking point, shoots the man in the head.</li>
  <li>The taunting continues even as the body dies; now, the voice matches the one Charlotte heard in her mirror-vision. The body fails before the spirit and Larkin is no more.</li>
  <li>The desk boy, having seen the whole thing, flees for help, but Ed and Storm knock him out and bring to Jacksons room.</li>
  <li>They wrap Larkin in a rug and pour booze on the desk boy to discredit him. They determine to leave Puno immediately, and Jackson reveals Narya shared the location of the temple; they must beat Mendoza there and put an end to the Kharisari and the curse.</li>
  <li>Analise drives their truck into the mountains. As the sun rises they set out on foot to find and end the source of this old evil…</li>
</ul>
