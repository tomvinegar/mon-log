        <h1>Four: Onward to Puno</h1>
<p>16 Jun 2020</p>

<ul>
  <li>Charlotte views the mirror: a dark figure demands from her a promise. She accepts.</li>
  <li>Analise reads Trinidad’s annotations and learns that the golden rod is part of a protective ward; the conquistadors broke the ward looting the temple, thus creating the Kharisari curse. To end the curse, they must put the ward back in place.</li>
  <li>Charlotte studies the strange journal in the box and realizes it possesses power and forbidden magic. She begins her studies.</li>
  <li>At Hotel Espana Jon deflects the police. Checking Mendoza’s room, he learns the man had returned for his missing mirror but is again vanished.</li>
  <li>Jon finds Larkin in a drug induced stupor. He deftly swipes the golden rod.</li>
  <li>Jackson suggests they go without Larkin but the group decides they will work with him. They burn the maggot with the golden rod Jon retrieved.</li>
  <li>The following day they enjoy the sights and sounds of Lima. Larkin joins them for dinner and asks if any of them have seen the rod, but they feign ignorance.</li>
  <li>On Monday Analise begins the drive to Puno, which takes 4 days all told.</li>
  <li>Arriving in Puno, Jackson and the group set out to find Jackson’s friend Narya, a wise-woman he was working with to find the temple when he first encountered Larkin.</li>
  <li>At her house they find a mysterious man lurking about; as soon as he spots Jackson he reveals himself to be a Kharisari. They easily slay him and sever his head, causing true death. The melee draws attention and horror and they flee the scene.</li>
  <li>Jackson finds another friend of his and they set out on a boat to a man-made floating island. On the island, Narya awaits…</li>
