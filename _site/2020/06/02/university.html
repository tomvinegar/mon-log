<ul>
  <li>Ed and John head to the Hotel Espana to secure funds for their gear. John charms the aged owner, Pentronilia, while Ed searches.</li>
  <li>Both Larkin and de Mendoza are out of the hotel. Ed confirms that Larkin is a heroin user. He also steals an artifact hidden in de * Mendoza’s room. The two take their leave.
Meanwhile, Analise attends a church service then takes a confession with the priest. The confession becomes dark and twisted. Analise flees in terror.</li>
  <li>At the university Hank and Charlotte grapple with de Mendoza in the dark. Jackson appears and blasts de Mendoza with a shotgun.</li>
  <li>Charlotte takes the box that Trinidad had been retrieving. Within are a book, some artifacts, and a golden rod. A translation stuffed into the book suggests the rod was part of a mystical ward that conquistadors broke when they stole the gold, unleashing evil in the pyramid and creating the Kharisari.</li>
  <li>Analise rejoins with Ed and John. They notice rising from the university down the road and head toward it.</li>
  <li>At the school, the others smell the smoke .Jackson recalls Sanchez is alone; the trio rush to the professor to find de Mendoza joined to him by the mouth, regurgitating a large, plump maggot into Sanchez’s mouth…</li>
